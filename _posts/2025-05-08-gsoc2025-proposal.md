## About me
I am currently pursuing a Dual Degree in Mathematics and Software Engineering at King Juan Carlos University. I started programming at 15 with Python, then moved into web development using JavaScript, React, Express.js, and MongoDB. Upon entering university, I developed a strong interest in systems programming with C and Rust, as well as neural networks. My main passion lies in Rust, particularly in systems programming and compiler design.

## Contributions
**Prevent ICE in Autodiff Validation by Emitting User-Friendly Errors:** [#138231](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/138231)


## Project Details
**Size:** Medium (~175 hours)
### Abstract
The integration of automatic differentiation (autodiff) into the Rust compiler using Enzyme has encountered issues due to conflicting ABI transformations in Rust. These adjustments (sometimes optimizations) generally improve performance but interfere with autodiff functionality. The goal of this project is to prevent undesired ABI modifications for functions marked with the `#[rustc_autodiff]` attribute without impacting the performance of other functions.
> [!NOTE]
> `#[autodiff]` attribute is a macro frontend that generates a placeholder function and applies two `#[rustc_autodiff]` attributes: one to the original function and one to the new dummy function (which will later become the derivative of the original function).

### Primary Goals
- Ensure that `rustc` does not apply ABI adjustments to functions with the `#[rustc_autodiff]` attribute.
- Develop a general solution that enables the `#[autodiff(..)]` attribute to handle arbitrary function headers correctly.

### Secondary Goals
- Fix bugs in the autodiff frontend.
- Contribute to the EnzymeAD Rust documentation.

### Constraints
- The changes must not introduce any performance overhead for functions that do not have the `#[rustc_autodiff]` attribute.

### Technical Approach
The goal is to identify and disable undesired adjustments for functions marked with `#[autodiff]`. The following steps outline the technical process:

#### 1. Determine and Categorize ABI Adjustments:
**Goal:** Establish a clear scope by identifying where known optimizations introduce ABI adjustments that affect autodiff. Additionally, detect any new potential changes that may not have been previously considered.

**Implied actions:**
- Map out function headers and call sites where ABI modifications occur.
- Analyze how Rust’s layout and calling conventions interact with these adjustments.
- Categorize optimization-driven changes in function signatures to define key areas for intervention.
- Investigate potential ABI-related modifications that may have gone unnoticed and assess their impact.


#### 2. Lower `#[autodiff(..)]` Attribute Information to ABI Level

**Goal:** Make the compiler explicitly recognize, at the ABI level, that a function will be differentiated, ensuring that ABI adjustments are prevented only for these functions.

**Implied Actions:** 
- Modify `FnAbi` layout to encode differentiation-related information.
- Introduce a mechanism that allows the compiler to lower differentiation status, preventing ABI adjustments specifically for autodiff functions.
- Ensure this information is correctly propagated through Rust’s compilation pipeline.

#### 3. Prevent ABI Adjustments That Break Autodiff

**Goal:** Prevent adjustments that interfere with autodiff, while allowing necessary compiler optimizations.

**Implied Actions:**
- Modify layout handling to avoid breaking autodiff functions.
- Use `AttributeKind::OptimizeNone` where necessary.
- Validate that these changes do not negatively impact performance for non-autodiff functions.

#### 4. Testing and Refinement
**Goal:** Validate correctness and robustness through testing, ensuring both functional accuracy and proper code generation.

**Implied Actions:**
- Develop functional tests covering all identified problematic cases.
- Implement codegen tests to verify that the expected ABI adjustments (or lack thereof) occur at the LLVM IR level.
- Refine the approach based on common function headers and performance benchmarks.

#### Examples of Incorrectly Handled Function Headers
First, we will examine those transformations that occur at `OptLevel::Aggressive`, but not at `OptLevel::None`. These will be considered optimizations.

- `fn foo(x: &[T;n])`, where `T` is an `Scalar` type and `n` is less or equal than 2. See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2024&gist=0454523e9d44c482304488d06fb4572f).
In this family of function headers, the individual elements of the slice are passed as value.
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::Aggressive</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Expected</td><td><code>ptr align 4 %x</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Actual</td><td><code>float %x.0.val, float %x.4.val</code></td></tr> </table>

- `fn foo(f: fn(f32) -> f32, x: f32)`. See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2024&gist=65a24aebbe85cd671ed513deb8daf8d0).
This optimization is triggered even if applying the #[inline(never)] attribute to the callback function.
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::Aggressive</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Expected</td><td><code>ptr %f, float %x</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Actual</td><td><code>float noundef %x</code></td></tr> </table>

- `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a f32, /* static */ y: &'a f32)`. See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=nightly&mode=release&edition=2024&gist=7c4c3c68ae1d8bed8f1669ca57ed0efc).
The static variable is elided from the function signature.
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::Aggressive</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Expected</td><td><code>ptr align 4 %x, ptr align 4 %y</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Actual</td><td><code>float %x.0.val</code></td></tr> </table>

- `fn foo(x: &dyn MyTrait)`. See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2024&gist=0aabd8edae53903fd430dc4a507314fd).
    `// Note(Sa4dUs): i really don't know what's the expected behaviour here, but changing from two params to zero doesn't seem good for Enzyme backend. (UPDATE: pending the response from the creator of Enzyme on whether to include it in the proposal, but if something extra were to be added, this would possibly be the most interesting candidate.)`
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::Aggressive</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Debug</td><td><code>ptr align 1 %x.0, ptr align 8 %x.1</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Release</td><td><code>()</code></td></tr> </table>
    
    
Now, we have two cases that also cause issues with the Enzyme backend, but these transformations occur even at `OptLevel::None`. This is likely due to how Rust handles functions at a low level.
    
- `fn foo(x: (T, ...))`, where `T` is an `Scalar` type and `n` is less or equal than 2. See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=release&edition=2024&gist=17af72271af41f9070eddcf828125c5a).
Same as the previous case.
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::No</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Expected</td><td><code>ptr align 4 %x</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Actual</td><td><code>float %x.0.val, float %x.4.val</code></td></tr> </table>
    
- `fn foo(i: T)`, where `T` is a `struct` with 2 or less scalar fields See [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2024&gist=953ae23bcfd74d0e064ed3e1a1a382a4).
This is also triggered even with `OptLevel::No`, so it may be related to the previous case.
    <table> <tr><td>Optimization Level</td><td><code>OptLevel::No</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Expected</td><td><code>ptr align 4 %x</code></td></tr> <tr><td>Actual</td><td><code>float %i.0, float %i.1</code></td></tr> </table>

### Deliverables
- **Midterm Evaluation**: The system should pass basic test cases, though still in early stages (not production-ready).
- **Final Evaluation**: Autodiff will handle most function headers correctly, with a robust test suite and comprehensive documentation.
